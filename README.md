# Temperature-Based DC Motor Speed Control

## Overview

This project focuses on controlling the speed of a DC motor based on the ambient temperature. The system utilizes a combination of analog and digital components: the **LM35** temperature sensor for temperature measurement, the **LM358** Op-Amp for comparing the sensor output with a reference voltage, the **555 Timer IC** to generate a PWM signal, and the **L293D motor driver** to control the motor's speed. As the temperature increases, the PWM signal's duty cycle increases, causing the motor to run faster.

## Key Components

- **LM35**: A temperature sensor that outputs an analog voltage proportional to the ambient temperature, with a sensitivity of 10 mV per °C.
- **LM358**: An operational amplifier configured as a comparator to compare the temperature sensor's output with a reference voltage set by a **potentiometer**.
- **555 Timer IC**: A timer IC configured in astable mode to generate a continuous PWM signal. The duty cycle of this signal is controlled by the output from the Op-Amp.
- **L293D**: A motor driver IC used to drive the DC motor by adjusting the voltage applied to the motor based on the PWM signal.
- **DC Motor**: The motor whose speed is controlled by the PWM signal generated by the 555 Timer and regulated by the L293D motor driver.
- **Potentiometer**: Used to set the reference voltage for the comparison with the LM35 output, determining the threshold temperature at which the motor speed increases.

## Working Principle

1. **Temperature Measurement**: The **LM35** temperature sensor detects the ambient temperature and generates a voltage output that is linearly proportional to the temperature (e.g., 250 mV at 25°C).
   
2. **Signal Comparison**: The **LM358 Op-Amp** compares the output from the **LM35** with a reference voltage set by the **potentiometer**. When the temperature exceeds the threshold set by the potentiometer, the Op-Amp output switches states.
   
3. **PWM Signal Generation**: The output of the **LM358** Op-Amp is used to control the **555 Timer IC**'s duty cycle. The **555 Timer** generates a PWM signal in astable mode, where the duty cycle is determined by the Op-Amp output. As the temperature rises, the Op-Amp output increases the PWM duty cycle, resulting in a faster motor speed.
   
4. **Motor Speed Control**: The PWM signal generated by the **555 Timer** is fed to the **L293D motor driver**, which adjusts the speed of the **DC motor**. The motor speed increases with higher temperature due to the higher PWM duty cycle.

## Circuit Setup

1. **Temperature Sensing**: The **LM35** is connected to a power supply (typically 5V). Its output is connected to the non-inverting input of the **LM358** Op-Amp.
   
2. **Reference Voltage**: The reference voltage is set using the **potentiometer**. The wiper of the potentiometer is connected to the inverting input of the **LM358**.
   
3. **PWM Signal Generation**: The output of the **LM358** is connected to the control voltage pin (pin 5) of the **555 Timer IC**, adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM signal generated by the timer.
   
4. **Motor Control**: The PWM signal from the **555 Timer** is fed into the **L293D motor driver**, which regulates the power supplied to the **DC motor** based on the PWM signal, controlling the motor speed according to the temperature.
